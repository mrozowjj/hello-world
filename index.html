                It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Fatal. File not found. Soon enough. These old Doomsday Devices
                are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
            </P>

            <p>
                would I want to know that?

                I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhhâ€¦
                also, comes with double prize money.
                Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.
                You don't know how to do any of those.
                That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Kif might! I was having the most wonderful dream.
                Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! I videotape every customer that comes in
                here, so that I may blackmail them later.

                Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.
                You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?
